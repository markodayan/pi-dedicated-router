1. First do 'sudo raspi-config' and disable serial port on console login and enable hardware serial

2. Clone the repository (run the following whilst in Desktop directory)
git clone https://github.com/markodayan/xcallibre-linux.git

3. Rename the folder from xcallibre-linux to 'scripts'

4. Run the script in the install directory, install_dependencies.sh

5. Follow OBEX Guide: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=146328

6. Pair to pen using bluetoothctl and pin:12345 and Maybe Test Some Scripts

Remember
GPIO14 - Blue line of GSM (RX on module)
GPIO15 - Green line of GSM (TX on module)
GPIO23 - Yellow LED (Failure)
GPIO24 - Green LED (Received File / Successful Upload)
GPIO25 - Speaker
3V3 - Red KED (Powered by 3.3V pin to show when the device is powered on)
5V - Connected to 5V of GSM Module (GND connection of GSM Module connected to the transistor's collector)
GPIO16 - Transistor Base with 1K Resistor (Switches the GSM Module On & Off)

Next Tasks:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Create a Firebase Profile (Or MongoDB atlas) to store URL to do POST request to for file upload
- When connected to Internet (preferably a WiFi network) read the database for a URL set on client-side
- On the Pi, store this URL in a text document (lets call it post_credentials.json or .txt)
- When a PGC file is received and ready to be uploaded, read the text in post_credentials.json and store that in a variable in penbt.sh
- Use that variable in the curl POST request to do the file upload.
